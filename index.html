					You have probably heard words ‘Machine Learning’ a lot in a past few years and I just wanted to talk
					to you about what it actually means. So a lot of people think that artificial intelligence and
					machine learning are the same thing but they are not.

					I have already told about components of ML, now let's talk about main directions.
					Classical machine learning is often divided into two categories – Supervised and Unsupervised
					Learning.

					How will the bank know if you'll pay on credit or not? Bank has lots of profiles of people who took
					money before. They have data about age, education, salary and – most importantly – the fact of
					paying the money back.

					Finally, we get to something looks like real artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning is used
					in cases when your problem is not related to data at all, but you have an environment to live in.
					Like a video game world or a city for self-driving car.

					Despite all the effectiveness the idea behind these is overly simple. If you take a bunch of
					algorithms and force them to correct each other's mistakes, the overall quality of a system will be
